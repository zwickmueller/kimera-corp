          End User License Agreement
          Version 2.14
          Terminology & Licenses
          The terms and conditions set below establish an agreement between you (the Licensee) and kimera (the Supplier) governing the use of the Font Software (or “Font”) ordered by you. This End User License Agreement (“Agreement”, or “License”)
          becomes binding by downloading, installing, or otherwise using the Font Software provided by the Supplier.
          Ownership and Copyright
          The font software downloaded will always remain copyrighted to the Supplier. The font software and the intellectual property of the design contained are owned by the Supplier and/or its contractors.
          Purchasing licenses grants you limited rights to use the font software. You are not allowed to share, distribute, illegally copy, sublicense, lend, lease, or sell the font software, its design, or any portion of it. Except for your right to
          use the font software granted by this license, all other rights are owned and retained by the Supplier. You hereby agree that this term is contractual in nature and that the unauthorized use of the design of the Font Software shall be an
          infringement of the Supplier’s rights.
          Lawful Use of Product
          By purchasing any font software from the Supplier and upon full payment of the agreed usage fee, you are granted the right to use the font software as specified in the order.
          Desktop License
          With any purchase of a desktop license, you obtain a license to install the font software on the specified number of computers. These computers have to belong to the Licensee. You are allowed to connect to and use the font software with any
          number of output devices, belonging to the Licensee, such as printers. The font software may be passed to a commercial printer or other prepress facilities in the scope of a defined project, only to prepare for printing and print your
          documents. Third parties are not allowed to actively create new documents with font software that has been passed on for output only. If any modification to a document is to be made by a non-licensee, a new license must be purchased.
          Web License
          By purchasing a web license you are granted the right to embed the font software on one website domain owned by the Licensee with the specified web traffic. Only the original font software de­livered can be used. The font software has to be
          stored on the same server associated with the licensed domain. Technologies other than @font-face are not allowed. The use of third-party font hosting services is prohibited.
          App License
          The font software delivered with an app license can be embedded in one mobile application with the specified app downloads. The use of font software may be used for the development of the app.
          Social Media License
          A social media license grants the Licensee the right to use the font software on social media platforms with the specified number of followers. A desktop license has to be purchased and registered to the Licensee prior to purchasing a
          social
          media license.
          Video License
          With a video license, the Licensee can use the fonts to make content that has animated or moving images of any kind. This license is needed for creating video content for streaming services like YouTube, Netflix, Vimeo, Twitch but also
          television, movies, commercials, exhibition screens and video billboards. For video content that is being used on social media there needs to be both a video license and a social media license.
          Student License
          Student licenses authorize the Licensee to use the font software for private & private commercial purposes only and exclusively as long as being a student. Private Commercial purposes are cases where there is no third party (a client)
          involved. The Licensee can use the font software to create own commercial projects but would still need to purchase licenses for third parties.
          Corporate License
          The purchase of a corporate license grants the Licensee to install font software on an unlimited number of computers belonging to the Licensee, and/or embed the font software on one website domain owned by the Licensee with unlimited web
          traffic, and/or embed the font software in one mobile application with unlimited downloads, ­and/or use the font software on social media platforms with unlimited followers, and/or use the font software for animation/moving image purposes.
          Specific details must be discussed with and agreed by the Supplier.

          Trial License
          The use of font software of a trial license is allowed for testing purposes only. The use for commercial or personal public projects is prohibited. If the font software is to be used for a project, a license has to be purchased and
          registered.
          Modifications
          You are not allowed to convert, modify, or rename the font software under any circumstance. Any modifications must be discussed with the Supplier as a bespoke project.
          Purchase and Transfer of Licenses
          Licenses are not transferrable to other companies or individuals. You are allowed to purchase font software on behalf of a client. Your client must be registered as the Licensee after the purchase, informed about this agreement, and
          provided
          with the invoice related to the purchase. The client has to accept this agreement. You are not authorized to invoice your client at another price as the one displayed on our site.

          Limited Liability
          Although every effort has been taken to produce the font software to the highest standards, in no circumstance whatsoever will the Supplier be liable to you for any consequential, indirect, incidental, punitive or special damages including
          any lost profits, lost data or lost savings. All font software installed is done so at the Licensee’s risk.
          Miscellaneous
          Any breach of the terms of this agreement shall be cause for termination. The use of font software in any racist, homophobic, transphobic, or sexist context is prohibited. We will pursue legal action if you are found to be using our fonts
          illegally. We reserve the right to update this agreement at any time without prior consent or notice. You acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement.</p>
